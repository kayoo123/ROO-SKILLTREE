# Ragnarok Origin -- SKILLTREE

### URL: https://kayoo123.github.io/ROO-SKILLTREE/

Hello everyone,
I would like to create a small tool to help the Ragnarok Origin community to manage their talent tree.

I am not a developer and have no knowledge of HTML and JavaScript language.
So please be kind with my code ^^


**Any help is welcome !**

Please create a [new Issue](https://github.com/kayoo123/ROO-SKILLTREE/issues) if you want to give a suggestion or report bugs that happened on the website.


## RoadMap

- [x] use skilltree template
- [x] show skill with prerequis
- [x] hide skill without prerequis 
- [x] Show job level
- [x] Use share ability
- [x] Hide param with 0 level in qstring
- [ ] Compress qstring when share
- [x] block when reach max level
- [x] reset button
- [ ] skill description in modal
- [ ] add job level with titre (ex. Acolyte job lvl.17)
- [x] close modal when click outside windows
- [x] change background color when open modal
- [ ] select level description (not sure to want it)
- [ ] change color to match game palet
- [x] Change view to have all skill showed
- [x] welcome page
- [x] footer
- [ ] create lord knight Skilltree
- [ ] create high wizzard Skilltree
- [ ] create Master Smith Skilltree
